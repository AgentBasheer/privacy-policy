        <h1>Privacy Policy for Ghost VPN</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: May 31, 2025</p>

        <div class="important-notice">
            <strong>Important:</strong> This Privacy Policy explains how Ghost VPN ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our mobile application ("App") and related services (collectively, the "Services"). By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
            <strong>If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use our Services.</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We are committed to your privacy. Our goal is to provide a secure VPN service while being transparent about the data we handle to operate our free, ad-supported service.</p>

        <h3>1.1. Information We Do NOT Collect (VPN Activity):</h3>
        <p>We want to be clear about what we <strong>DO NOT</strong> log when you use our VPN service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your original IP address (once connected to our VPN server, your original IP is not associated with your browsing activity).</li>
            <li>Your browsing history or the websites you visit.</li>
            <li>DNS queries made while connected to our VPN.</li>
            <li>The specific content or data you transmit through the VPN tunnel.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2. Information We Collect to Provide and Improve Our Services:</h3>
        <p>To operate and improve Ghost VPN, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Usage Data (Aggregated & Anonymized):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connection timestamps (e.g., time of connection and disconnection – used for service maintenance and troubleshooting, not tied to your identity).</li>
                    <li>Choice of VPN server location (e.g., "USA - New York"). This helps us understand server popularity and optimize our network.</li>
                    <li>Total amount of data transferred per session (e.g., "500MB"). This is for bandwidth management and abuse prevention.</li>
                    <li>Information about your VPN connection success and any technical errors.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Device and Application Information:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Device type, operating system version, and device model.</li>
                    <li>App version.</li>
                    <li>Language settings.</li>
                    <li>Unique device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID (AAID), iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA)). These identifiers can be reset by you in your device settings.</li>
                    <li>Network information (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular connection).</li>
                </ul>
                This information is used for app functionality, troubleshooting, analytics to improve user experience, and to serve advertisements.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Information for Advertising:</strong>
                <p>Since Ghost VPN is a free app, we rely on advertising to support our service. We work with third-party advertising partners who may collect and use information about your device and interaction with ads. This may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your device’s advertising ID (AAID/IDFA).</li>
                    <li>Your device's IP address (which may be used to estimate your general location for serving geo-relevant ads, but is not stored by us in connection with your browsing activity).</li>
                    <li>Information about the ads you are shown and whether you interact with them (e.g., clicks).</li>
                    <li>Device characteristics (as mentioned in "Device and Application Information").</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our advertising partners use this information to show you ads that are more likely to be relevant to your interests. You can often opt-out of interest-based advertising through your device settings. Please consult your device’s documentation for more information.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Services:</strong> To operate the VPN, manage user sessions, and ensure the stability and security of our network.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve Our Services:</strong> To understand how users interact with our App, identify areas for improvement, diagnose technical issues, and develop new features.</li>
            <li><strong>To Provide Customer Support:</strong> To respond to your inquiries and provide assistance.</li>
            <li><strong>To Display Advertisements:</strong> To show advertisements within the App, which helps us offer the Services for free. This may include personalized or contextual advertising based on the limited data collected by our ad partners.</li>
            <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> To comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or governmental requests.</li>
            <li><strong>To Enforce Our Terms of Service:</strong> To protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of you or others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Third-Party Advertising Partners:</strong> As described in Section 1.2, we share device identifiers and related data with third-party ad networks to display advertisements within our App. These partners help us keep Ghost VPN free. These companies may use information about your device and your interaction with ads in our App and on other apps or websites to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These partners operate under their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to be aware of them. You can often control a portion of the data collected by ad networks for personalized advertising through your mobile device's settings.
            </li>
            <li><strong>With Analytics Providers:</strong> We may use third-party analytics services to help us understand app usage, identify trends, and improve our Services. These providers may collect and process anonymized or aggregated data about your use of the App, such as app features used, session duration, and general device information. This information helps us improve the user experience. These analytics providers also operate under their own privacy policies.
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Comply with a legal obligation or a valid legal process (e.g., a subpoena or court order).</li>
                    <li>Protect and defend our rights or property.</li>
                    <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Services.</li>
                    <li>Protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public.</li>
                    <li>Protect against legal liability.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via a prominent notice within the App or by email (if we have it) of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>We recommend checking our website or app settings periodically for an updated list of any specific third-party advertising and analytics partners we may engage with, along with links to their respective privacy policies.</em></p>


        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain the limited information we collect for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Aggregated and anonymized data may be kept for longer periods for analytical purposes.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free, and no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Data Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR for EEA users, CCPA for California residents), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> The right to access the personal information we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> The right to request correction of inaccurate personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> The right to request deletion of your personal information, subject to certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Restriction of Processing:</strong> The right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> The right to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.</li>

If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:pbro4321@gmail.com">pbro4321@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>8. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
        <p>Our App may contain links to third-party websites or services, including advertisements. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to them.</p>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy and, where feasible, through a notice within the App or by other means.
